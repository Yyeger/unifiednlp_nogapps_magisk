Magisk Module to install unifiednlp WITHOUT any sort of google implementation

Script to install UnifiedNLP on android stock roms without GMS, so it is signed as "com.google.android.location".

I have been able to install it on my Surya device (poco x3 NFC) with firmware 14.0, CrDroid 9.11 A13, DEXK kernel, no gapps, no microG or anything like that.

Is it worth it? no, just go outside and let the GPS do it's thing, it's gonna be far more precise and reliable than any network location provider, or simply ask people for directions.
